# 1 - KNN model
Simple model knn with sklearn libriary. Dataset for knn model - Iris dataset. This is a base dataset and a classic ml model for the first step.
# 2 - Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge
The linear regression file used the sklearn library and a dataset of Californian houses. Three models were used: linear regression, lasso and ridge. The first models were without parameters, the next ones were with different alpha parameters.
# 3 - Logistic Regression
The logistic regression file used the Sklearn library and a standard cancer classification dataset. As in linear regression, at first the model was with a standard parameter, namely C = 1.0, and subsequently the standard value was replaced by others.
# 4 - LinearSVC
LinearSVC model that classifies the make blobs dataset. The model was trained and the results were visualized with a decision boundary.
